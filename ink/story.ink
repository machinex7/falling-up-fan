// FALLING UP FLIGHT DECK — story source, compiled to data/story.json by
// scripts/compile-ink.js (via npm run compile:ink, or the GitHub Action in
// .github/workflows/compile-ink.yml). Never hand-edit data/story.json —
// edit here and recompile. See AGENTS.md's "The cutscene system" for the
// tag conventions (# contact / # image / # countdown) and how js/story.js
// drives this file's knots.
//
// Split into more files as this grows — INCLUDE another .ink file (e.g.
// INCLUDE characters/handler.ink) and scripts/compile-ink.js will pull it
// in automatically, no changes needed there.

Handler to [ship]. Comms check — you still with me out there?
* [Reading you loud and clear.]
    Good. Numbers on my end look nominal. How's the crew holding up?
    * * [Holding steady.]

    * * [Ask me again in a week.]
        -> close
* [...Barely. Signal's rough.]
    Copy that — we'll keep this short, then. Flag it if it degrades further.
    * * [Will do.]

Copy. Handler out — check in again next relay.
